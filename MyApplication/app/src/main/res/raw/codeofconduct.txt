Code of Conduct

The safety of our users is very important to us. There are steps that everyone can follow to ensure their safety while using Helpr App. Please take a few minutes to read these tips.

Keep your financial information private
Ignore any request to send money – even if the person claims to be in an emergency – and report it to us immediately. Never give out financial information such as your social security number, credit card number or bank information.

Keep your personal information
You are in control of your Helpr App experience at all times – remain anonymous until you feel ready. Be careful about sharing personal information, such as your full name, phone number, email and address. Protect your identity until you are comfortable enough with someone to share it. Also, leave any personal contact information out of your Tinder profile.
Note: Helpr App will never send you an email asking for your username and password information. Any such communication should be reported immediately.

•	Sends you messages containing links to third-party websites
•	Quickly asks to talk or chat outside of Helpr
•	Asks you for money
•	Vanishes mysteriously then reappears under a different name
•	Asks for your address under the guise of sending flowers or gifts

Report suspicious users Please report anyone who violates our terms of use. Examples of terms of use violations include:
•	Asking you for money or donations
•	Anyone who is not part of King’s College London
•	Users sending harassing or offensive messages
•	Users behaving inappropriately after meeting in person
•	Fraudulent profiles
•	Spam or solicitation, such as attempts to sell products or services

Meeting In Person
First meetings are exciting, but always take precautions and follow these guidelines to help you stay safe:

Get to know the other person before meeting them offline
Get to know someone through chat before disclosing personal information or meeting in person. We don't conduct criminal background checks on our users, so it’s up to you to do your own research and remain cautious.

Always meet in public
Meet for the first time in a populated, public place – never in a private or remote location, and never at your home or apartment. Ideally students should meet on compass. 

Tell a friend or family member of your plans.
Tell them who you are meeting, where you are going and when you will return. Bring your phone with you.
